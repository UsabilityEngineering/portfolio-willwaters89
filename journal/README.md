When trying to lose, gain, or maintain one’s weight, counting calories is essential to know how much you are eating to adjust based on your preferences. Writing down each item you eat in one day and adding everything together can be a hassle, especially when you are focusing on micro and macro nutrients. So that’s why MyFitnessPal offers an application to **efficiently** log everything you eat or drink during the day. 
To start, simple open your smartphone’s app store and type in “MyFitnessPal”. Once it is downloaded, open the application and sign up for an account, or you can optionally sign up with an existing google or apple account. It will ask you if you want to lose weight, maintain weight, or gain weight and will then prompt for your sex, weight, and height. After entering that information it will calculate your daily calorie goal for you, which I found to be **satisfying**. Once logged in a dashboard screen will be displayed with your daily goal.
